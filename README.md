### Football Database & Visualisation

Aims 
The aim of this project was to create a Postgres database of football data from Understats API which can be used for data visualisations going forward.


Methods
Data was collected using Understats API


Outcome
Using the main.py file the code collects the data from the understat API for both matches and shots before cleaning and wrangling the data to the desired structure. Once the data is clean a Postgres database is created using the SQLAlchemy package in python.
